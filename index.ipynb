    "# Covariance and Correlation - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will work towards calculating covariance and correlation for a given dataset in python. You'll use the formulas shown in previous lessons and verify our results with python libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Calculate and interpret correlation and covariance for given variables\n",
    "* Build density and scatter plots to visually identify the level of dependence between variables\n",
    "* Compute covariance and correlation using numpy and pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Included dataset (heightWeight.csv) includes 20 heights (in inches) and weights (in pounds). This small dataset will help us focus more on seeing covariance and correlation in action!\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you should be able to calculate the average height and average weight. You can also explain the medians, variances and standard deviations for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "But all of those measurements are only concerned with a **single variable**. In this lab, you'll answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How does height interact with weight? \n",
    "2. Does weight increase as height increases?\n",
    "3. Are weight and height not related at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are always exceptions, but when you look at the population in general, taller people will tend to weigh more than shorter people. While you should *always* be cautious when generalizing, generalization of information can be very useful as it shows you a bigger picture that you can build your intuitions upon. This is also what a lot of core statistical principles are built upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's load this dataset in python using pandas. Next, print the length of the data, the head of the data, and the basic statistics of the data."

In practice, however, you'll see the two formulas are often being used interchangeably. \n",

The idea is that you take each element in $x$ and $y$ and respectively subtract the mean of $x$ and $y$. The result is that your \"altered\" x and y now have mean 0.\n",

And there is a takeaway in this. sample size plays a major rule in determining the nature of a variable and its relationship with other variables. The set of 20 records we have seem to correlate highly, but if you look at 20 other people, you'll see that this result will be different. The correlation here will depend on the _sample_, and you'll see that this will differ more clearly when working with smaller samples.\n",
